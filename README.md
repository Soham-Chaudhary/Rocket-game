# Rocket-game  
Made in unity 2022.3.25f1
One of first games I ever made in unity
The game uses A,D and space for controls 
A for left
D for right 
space for throtlle 
the game takes its inpiration from flappy birds but with a twist of realistic graphics and flappy bird is now rocket
which you have to land on the desired location which will take you to the next level.
